# AFK Scripts

A collection of scripts that require `Slyme_AFK`. This includes the base AFK script, the nameplate extension script, and the animation extension script.

## Base AFK

Built to be required. It returns a function that returns either `nil` or how long you've been AFK for in ticks. The default delay time for becoming AFK is 15 seconds but can be changed with the `afkDelay` variable.
