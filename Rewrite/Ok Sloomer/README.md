<h1 align="center">Ok Sloomer - Zoom Script for Figura</h1>

A zoom script complete with scrolling and spyglass sounds. The script also keeps your keybind set in the Keybinds menu!
# Candler Integration
Ok Sloomer adds one command to Candler: .zoom. This is how you configure Ok Sloomer.
# Planned Features
- Cinematic Camera
  - Impossible in Figura
- Mouse Sensitivity
  - Also impossible.
  - **UPDATE:** With #"Extura", it is now possible to set sensitivity. However, it does not support getting the sensitivity, so we'll have to wait a bit longer for this to come to Sloomer.
